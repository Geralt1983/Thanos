# Reports Index

This folder contains generated reports, verification outputs, and test artifacts moved from the repo root.

## Notes
- If a doc or script referenced old root-level report paths, update it to `docs/reports/<filename>`.
- Keep only generated artifacts here; source docs belong in `docs/`.
