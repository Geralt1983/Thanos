# Report Lifecycle

## Purpose
Keep active diagnostics and test reports easy to find without cluttering the repo root.

## Rules
- **Active reports** live at repo root only while they are actionable.
- **Resolved or stale reports** must be moved to `archive/reports/`.
- **Naming**: include a date suffix (`YYYY-MM-DD`) for diagnostics or time-boxed reports.
- **Do not delete** reports; archive them to preserve history.

## When to archive
- A report’s issue is fixed or superseded by a newer report.
- A report is a one-off investigation or postmortem.
- Any report older than 30 days unless explicitly pinned.
