# GitHub Actions workflow for Python linting with Ruff
#
# This workflow runs Ruff linter on all Python files to ensure code quality
# and consistency. It runs on:
# - Every push to main branch
# - Every pull request to main branch
# - Can be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch
#
# Configuration:
# - Linting rules are defined in pyproject.toml
# - Exclusions are defined in .ruffignore
# - See CONTRIBUTING.md for local development linting commands
#
# To run locally:
#   ruff check .
#
# To auto-fix issues:
#   ruff check --fix .
#
# To format code:
#   ruff format .
