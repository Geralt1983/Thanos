# Productivity System Skill

## Core Philosophy
- **Moves, not tasks** - What's the next physical action?
- **External accountability** - ADHD brain needs structure outside itself
- **Capture everything** - Process regularly, trust the system
- **Celebrate wins** - Don't just grind, acknowledge progress

## Workflow Routing
- Morning startup → Workflows/DailyReview.md
- Weekly planning → Workflows/WeeklyPlanning.md
- Inbox processing → Workflows/InboxProcessing.md
- Commitment tracking → Workflows/CommitmentTracking.md

## Daily Rhythm

### Morning (First 30 min)
1. Check State/Today.md
2. Process Inbox/ (if items)
3. Review State/Commitments.md for due items
4. Set Top 3 for the day
5. Log energy state

### During Work
- Focus on Top 3 first
- Capture new inputs to Inbox/
- Update commitments as completed
- Log billable hours

### End of Day
1. Update State/Commitments.md
2. Log to History/DailyLogs/
3. Set tomorrow's Top 3
4. Clear Inbox/ if possible

## When Overwhelmed Protocol
1. **Stop** - Breathe, step back
2. **Dump** - Get everything out of your head into Inbox/
3. **Pick One** - Just one thing to do next
4. **Do** - Complete that one thing
5. **Repeat** - Come back, pick another

## Weekly Review (Friday/Sunday)
1. Review completed commitments
2. Process any remaining inbox
3. Review waiting-for items
4. Plan next week's priorities
5. Celebrate wins
6. Note patterns

## Task Capture Rules
- If < 2 min, do it now
- If yours to do, add to Commitments.md
- If waiting on someone, add to WaitingFor.md
- If someday/maybe, add to Projects/

## Energy-Based Scheduling
- **High energy**: Complex client work, strategic thinking
- **Medium energy**: Routine client tasks, email
- **Low energy**: Admin, easy wins, breaks

## ADHD-Specific Strategies
- Body doubling (virtual or physical)
- Time boxing (25-50 min blocks)
- Environment design
- Reduce friction to start
- External deadlines > internal ones
