## Key Insights (Sep 2025 - Jan 2026)
1. **November was anomaly** (low), not December (expected holiday)
2. **Restaurants $3K+/mo** - biggest discretionary leak
3. **Home Improvement** spiky - one-time purchases inflate averages
4. **Grocery inflation** - Sam's bulk purchases help but still high
5. **$149.77 Apple charge (Jan 2)** - no receipt, likely in-app (Roblox/games)
