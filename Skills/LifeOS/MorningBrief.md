## Data Sources

| Section | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Commitments Due | State/Commitments.md (filter by today's date) |
| Top 3 Priorities | State/CurrentFocus.md → Today's Top 3 |
| Waiting For | State/WaitingFor.md (items needing follow-up) |
| Yesterday's Incomplete | Previous day's Today.md unchecked items |
| Calendar | GSuite MCP if available |

---

## Generation Process

1. **Query Time**: Confirm it's morning, first session
2. **Read State Files**:
   - State/Today.md (or yesterday's if today's doesn't exist)
   - State/CurrentFocus.md
   - State/Commitments.md
   - State/WaitingFor.md
   - State/ThisWeek.md
3. **Query Memory**: Claude Flow memory for recent patterns
4. **Check Calendar**: GSuite MCP for today's events (if connected)
5. **Generate Brief**: Compile into format above
6. **Create Today.md**: Generate fresh Today.md for current date
7. **Ask Energy**: Prompt for energy level to calibrate recommendations

---

## Energy-Based Recommendations

After user provides energy level:

| Energy | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| 1-3 | "Low energy. Do ONE easy win first to build momentum. Consider: {easiest task}" |
| 4-6 | "Moderate energy. Start with {medium priority} to warm up, then tackle {top priority}" |
| 7-10 | "High energy. Attack {hardest/most important task} now while you have capacity" |

---

## Post-Brief Actions

1. Update State/Today.md with:
   - Current date
   - Energy level (once captured)
   - Vyvanse status (ask if not mentioned)
   - Priorities for day
2. Store morning state in Claude Flow memory
3. Set context for OPERATOR mode for rest of day
