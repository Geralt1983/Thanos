# Skills Directory

This directory contains project-specific skills and references. Each skill folder should include a `SKILL.md` with usage instructions and any supporting scripts/references.

## Conventions

- `SKILL.md` is required for each skill folder.
- Place references in `references/` and scripts in `scripts/`.
- Legacy or experimental skills should be clearly labeled.
