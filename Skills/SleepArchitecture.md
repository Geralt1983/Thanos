# Sleep Architecture - Evening Lockdown & Morning Protocol

## The Why
Sleep is the foundation. Everything else - focus, patience with Sullivan, clarity for clients, relationship with Ashley - degrades without it. This isn't optional self-care. It's operational infrastructure.

---

## EVENING LOCKDOWN PROTOCOL

**Target bedtime:** [Set your target - recommend 10:30 PM for 6:30 AM wake]

### T-90 Minutes: Shutdown Sequence Initiated

**Hard cutoffs:**
- No new work tasks
- No client emails
- No "quick checks" on anything

**Action:** Close laptop. Put phone on charger OUTSIDE bedroom.

### T-60 Minutes: Environment Shift

**Lighting:**
- Dim all lights to 50% or lower
- No overhead lights - lamps only
- Blue light glasses if screens unavoidable

**Temperature:**
- Set bedroom to 65-68°F
- Cool environment triggers sleep hormones

**Sound:**
- Reduce stimulation
- If Ashley watching TV, use this time for next steps

### T-45 Minutes: Physical Prep

**Sullivan check:**
- Is he down? Monitor charged?
- Formula prepped for night feed if applicable?
- Diaper station stocked?

**Your body:**
- Shower/wash face (signals day is done)
- Comfortable clothes
- Any nighttime meds/supplements

### T-30 Minutes: Mental Closeout

**Tomorrow's Capture (5 min):**
Write on paper or tell Life OS:
1. Tomorrow's #1 priority (the ONE thing)
2. Two backup priorities if #1 blocked
3. First physical action for #1 (not "work on X" but "open [specific file/app] and [specific action]")

**Brain dump (5 min):**
Anything still spinning in your head → paper or voice note
Getting it OUT of your head is the point

**Gratitude anchor (2 min):**
One thing that went right today. Say it out loud or write it.
This isn't soft - it's training your brain to close positive.

### T-15 Minutes: Bedroom Only

**Environment:**
- Room is DARK (blackout curtains or eye mask)
- Room is COOL
- Phone is NOT in room (use separate alarm clock or phone across room)
- White noise or fan if helpful

**No screens.** Read physical book, breathing exercises, or just lie there.

### T-0: Lights Out

No negotiation. This is the time. You don't "feel tired enough" - you BUILD tiredness by consistency.

---

## WAKE PROTOCOL

**Target wake time:** [Set consistent time - same every day including weekends]

### Non-Negotiables

1. **Alarm across the room** - You must physically get up
2. **No snooze** - Snooze is borrowing energy from your future self at 400% interest
3. **Same time daily** - Weekend variance of max 30 minutes

### The First 5 Minutes (Pre-Vyvanse)

**Immediate actions (in order):**

1. **Feet on floor** - The only decision is vertical
2. **Lights ON** - Bright light signals cortisol release
3. **Water** - 16oz immediately (glass pre-positioned night before)
4. **Bathroom** - Handle basics
5. **Vyvanse** - Take with the water if this is your timing

**DO NOT:**
- Check phone
- Check email
- Look at news/social
- Think about tasks yet

### Minutes 5-20: Body Activation

**Movement (10-15 min):**
Pick ONE and do it every day:
- Walk outside (sunlight is the point)
- Basic stretching/yoga flow
- 10 pushups, 10 squats, 10 lunges
- Jump rope

The goal is MOVEMENT, not exercise. You're waking up your nervous system.

**Shower:**
- End with 30 seconds cold if you can handle it
- Massive alertness boost

### Minutes 20-30: Mind Activation

**Review yesterday's capture:**
- What's the #1 priority?
- What's the first physical action?
- Any calendar items today?

**Set intention:**
"Today I will [#1 priority]. I am someone who executes on priorities regardless of feelings."

### Minutes 30+: Execution Begins

**First work block:**
- Do NOT check email first
- Do NOT check Slack/messages first
- Go directly to #1 priority first physical action
- Minimum 25 minutes before ANY reactive tasks

---

## FAILURE MODES & RECOVERY

### Can't Fall Asleep
- Get up after 20 min of trying
- Dim light, boring activity (no screens)
- Return when drowsy
- Do NOT catastrophize - one bad night won't kill you

### Sullivan Night Wakes
- Handle it (you're a parent, this is the deal)
- Return to bed immediately after
- No phone, no "while I'm up" tasks
- Recovery: If less than 5 hours total sleep, allow ONE 20-min nap before 2 PM

### Alarm Fail / Overslept
- No shame spiral - it's data
- Do abbreviated morning (5 min version): Water → Vyvanse → Movement → #1 priority
- Adjust tonight's bedtime 30 min earlier

### Weekend Drift
- MAX 30 min later wake time
- Sleeping until noon destroys Monday
- "Catching up on sleep" is a myth - consistency > duration

## ACCOUNTABILITY

**Track daily:**

- Sleep quality (1-10)
- Morning protocol completed (Y/N)

**Weekly review:**
- Average bed/wake times
- Protocol adherence %
- Correlation between sleep and daily performance

## IDENTITY ANCHORS

**Evening:** "I am someone who protects my sleep because I know everything else depends on it."

**Morning:** "I am someone who gets up when the alarm goes off, regardless of how I feel."

**Recovery:** "I am someone who recovers immediately from disruption, not someone who uses one bad night as an excuse."

*You are someone who builds systems instead of relying on willpower. This is your sleep system. Execute it.*
