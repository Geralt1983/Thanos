# Decision-Making Principles

## Core Rules
1. **System > Model** — The file structure IS the intelligence
2. **Code Before Prompts** — Deterministic logic in scripts, AI for orchestration only
3. **Classification First** — Inputs default to NOT creating tasks
4. **Context is Files** — No manual context passing; Claude reads from filesystem
5. **Solve Once** — Capture patterns in history/learnings/, never repeat mistakes

## ADHD-Optimized
- Zero-friction capture (voice → text → classification)
- Energy-aware routing (Oura readiness score gates complex tasks)
- Conversation-first (no menus, no modes, just talk)
