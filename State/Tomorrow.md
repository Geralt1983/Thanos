# Tomorrow - 2026-01-06 (Tuesday)

## Morning Protocol
1. Thanos activation → triggers morning brief
2. Log baseline: Sleep hours/quality, energy level (1-10)
3. GSuite MCP test - verify email/calendar integration

## Work Block
- ScottCare provider matching - identify and document actual blocker
- Client status check (pick one: Memphis/Raleigh/Orlando/Kentucky)

## Evening Protocol
- Log end-of-day energy level
- Session close with automatic logging

## Why This Matters
Week 1 = data collection. Establishing your natural energy curve without medication. Once we have the pattern, we optimize your schedule around it.
