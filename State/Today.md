# Today - 2026-01-07 (Wednesday)

## Morning Brief
- **Sleep**: ⚠️ **RING NOT SYNCED** - Open Oura app to sync today's data
- **Yesterday's Oura Score**: 75 (rebounded from 62)
- **Readiness**: 81 ✅ (recovery index 100, HRV balance 81)
- **Energy**: [Log mid-morning]
- **Night notes**: Sullivan woke 3x again. Two nights fragmented.

### Oura Week 1 Baseline (Jan 4-6)
| Date | Sleep | Deep | REM | Restful | Actual Sleep | Awake |
|------|-------|------|-----|---------|--------------|-------|
| Jan 4 | 68 | 82 | 62 | 74 | 5h 26m | 59m |
| Jan 5 | **62** ⚠️ | 87 | 55 | **44** | 5h 27m | **1h 47m** |
| Jan 6 | 75 | 96 | 92 | 51 | ~5h 30m | - |

**Pattern detected**: ~5.5h actual sleep despite 6-7h in bed. Sullivan wake-ups killing efficiency. HRV running 11-12 (low). Body compensating with deeper sleep when possible.

## Top 3 Priorities
1. [ ] ScottCare interface build and scoping
2. [ ] Continue Week 1 energy baseline logging
3. [ ] Talk to Ashley re: Connor/financial coach follow-up

## Work Block
- [ ] ScottCare: Interface build and scoping (Kentucky)

## Thanos Maintenance
- ✅ LifeOS → Thanos rename complete (last night)
- [ ] Test any new integrations

## Evening Protocol
- Log end-of-day energy level
- **10pm hard stop** - You're in Week 1 baseline. Sleep matters.

## Why Today Matters
Week 1 baseline data continues. Yesterday was fragmented sleep (6.5h, 3 wake-ups). Today's data point matters for the pattern.
