# Today - 2026-01-06 (Tuesday)

## Morning Brief
- **Sleep**: 6.5 hours, fragmented (bed 10:30pm, asleep 12am, 3x wake-ups, alarm 6:30am)
- **Sleep quality**: Poor - hyperfocus on Life OS build delayed sleep onset
- **Energy**: 5-6/10 (suboptimal due to fragmented sleep)
- **Night notes**: 3am Sullivan feed + 2 other wake-ups

## Top 3 Priorities
1. [x] Log baseline energy data (Week 1 data collection starts)
2. [ ] Voice capture + journaling + memory enhancements
3. [ ] Pick up tirzepatide Rx from CVS

## Enhancement Requests (Today)
- [x] Voice capture integration for mobile/terminal (complete - Mac: whisper.cpp, Android: termux-api)
- [x] Journaling workflow enhancement (complete - terminal-native)
- [ ] Memory system improvements (pending)
- [x] Week 2-4 feature roadmap review (Architecture-Week2.md created)

## Work Block
- [ ] ScottCare provider matching - identify actual blocker
- [ ] Client status check (Memphis/Raleigh/Orlando/Nova)

## Evening Protocol
- Log end-of-day energy level
- Session close with git sync

## Why Today Matters
Week 1 baseline data. You're mapping natural energy patterns without medication. This is foundation data for optimizing your entire schedule.
