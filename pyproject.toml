# Python Project Configuration
# Ruff linting and formatting configuration for Thanos codebase
#
# Configuration Strategy:
# ----------------------
# This configuration balances code quality with pragmatism:
#
# 1. ENABLED RULES: Comprehensive coverage (F, E, W, I, N, D, UP, B, C4, T20, RET, SIM, PTH, ARG)
#    - Catches common errors, style violations, and potential bugs
#    - Enforces consistent import organization and naming conventions
#    - Suggests modern Python idioms and simplifications
#
# 2. GLOBAL IGNORES: Style rules that are too strict or conflict with project conventions
#    - Docstring rules (D212, D415, D205, etc.) - pragmatic docs over strict formatting
#    - Code style preferences (SIM117, RET505) - readability over rigid rules
#    - Gradual migration (PTH123) - allow legacy patterns during transition
#
# 3. PER-FILE IGNORES: Context-specific exceptions where rules don't apply
#    - Test files: Allow test-specific patterns (unused vars, long lines, missing docstrings)
#    - Command handlers: Allow consistent interface patterns (unused args in command_router.py)
#    - __init__ files: Allow re-export pattern (unused imports are actually public API)
#    - Conditional imports: Allow imports after feature detection (thanos_orchestrator.py)
#
# 4. REMAINING ERRORS (~201):
#    - 151 auto-fixable with --unsafe-fixes (UP006, UP035: modernize type hints)
#    - 32 line-too-long violations (E501) - require manual review
#    - 18 minor issues (docstrings, small bugbear warnings, etc.)
#
# Run 'ruff check --unsafe-fixes --fix .' to apply type hint modernization (List→list, Dict→dict)

    "SIM",   # flake8-simplify - suggest code simplifications

# Ignore specific rules that conflict with project style or are too strict

    "D104",   # Missing docstring in public package - __init__.py files often don't need them
    "D203",   # 1 blank line required before class docstring - conflicts with D211 (no blank line)
    "D205",   # 1 blank line required between summary and description - overly prescriptive
    "D212",   # Multi-line docstring summary should start at the first line - prefer summary on first line
    "D213",   # Multi-line docstring summary should start at the second line - conflicts with D212
    "D401",   # First line of docstring should be in imperative mood - too strict for descriptive docs
    "D415",   # First line should end with a period - not always appropriate (e.g., module names)

    # Code style preferences - readability over rigid rules
