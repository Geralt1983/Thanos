      "content": "Observation: Your Oura data shows a high energy level with a readiness score of 100 this morning, but the sleep score is currently null. This suggests your Oura Ring might not have fully synced or processed last night's sleep data.\n\nYour current energy state is marked as \"high\" with a perfect readiness score of 100, which typically indicates:\n- Good quality sleep\n- Effective recovery\n- Low physiological stress\n- Optimal conditions for high-cognitive work\n\nHowever, I cannot give you specific sleep metrics right now due to the null sleep score. Recommendations:\n1. Sync your Oura Ring\n2. Check the Oura app directly for detailed sleep stats\n3. Manually log your subjective sleep quality if you want to track it\n\nWould you like me to help you troubleshoot the sleep data sync?",
