# Session Log - 2026-01-05 22:36-23:42

## Duration
- Started: 22:36 EST
- Ended: 23:42 EST
- Length: 66 minutes

## Summary
Built complete Git sync automation for Life OS. Researched CLI task managers, rejected fragmentation, built unified GitHub sync instead. Created private Thanos repo with auto-commit on session close. Set up mobile access via Termux clone.

## Accomplishments
- **Git Infrastructure**: Fresh repo at ~/.claude, clean .gitignore, SSH remote configured
- **Auto-Sync Script**: Tools/sync-lifeos.sh executes on every session close
- **GitHub Integration**: Private repo Geralt1983/Thanos with automatic push
- **SessionLogging Update**: Git sync now part of session close protocol
- **Mobile Setup**: Clone script for Termux, auto-pull on boot
- **Mobile Deployment**: User cloned Life OS to mobile device via Tailscale
- **Task Manager Research**: Claude Flow swarm analyzed dstask/mdt/todo-md, recommended against fragmentation
- **Tirzepatide Log**: 10mg injection recorded 22:56
- **Vyvanse Status Update**: User no longer taking medication, energy tracking adjusted

## Decisions Made
- **No external task managers**: Keep TodoWrite + State/ files, avoid dstask/Todoist fragmentation
- **Git over complexity**: Simple git sync > dedicated task manager repos
- **Mobile architecture**: SSH to Mac for compute, local clone for offline reads
- **Repo name**: "Thanos" not "life-os" for consistency

## Technical Implementation
- Removed invalid GITHUB_TOKEN blocking gh CLI
- Fixed embedded git repo warnings (claude-plugins-official)
- Switched from HTTPS to SSH for authentication
- Cleaned git tracking (removed debug/, statsig/, projects/)
- Created mobile-setup.sh for automated Termux configuration

## State Changes
- Created: .gitignore, Tools/sync-lifeos.sh, Tools/mobile-setup.sh, Tools/setup-github-sync.md
- Updated: SessionLogging.md (added git sync step), CLAUDE.md (documented git sync), CORE.md (removed Vyvanse), CurrentFocus.md (updated energy tracking)
- Modified: Tomorrow.md created with 2026-01-06 plan

## Commitments Made
None new - focused on infrastructure build.

## Pattern Observations
- User corrected permission-seeking → Dangerous mode enforcement critical
- User wanted unified system → Validated Life OS native approach over tool sprawl
- Mobile access priority → Tailscale + GitHub + local clone = full coverage
- Infrastructure focus → Building foundation before feature requests

## Follow-ups Needed
- Tomorrow: Morning brief with baseline energy logging
- GSuite MCP integration test pending
- ScottCare provider matching blocker identification
- Energy tracking data collection starts (Week 1 baseline)

## Mode Corrections Applied
- Enforced zero permission mode in Thanos
- Silent edits for status updates
- Dangerous mode sandbox disabled for all bash commands
