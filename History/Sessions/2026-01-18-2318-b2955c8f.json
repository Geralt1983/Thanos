Nanny Services Research\n- Local agencies specializing in infant/special needs care\n- Verify backgrounds, rates, availability\n- Compile 3-5 top options by end of weekend\n\n2. Support Option Matrix\n- Part-time vs. full-time care\n- In-home vs. center-based\n- Cost ranges\n- Flexibility\n\n3. Soft Approach Strategy\n- Prepare gentle discussion points\n- Frame as \"exploring options\" not \"solving problems\"\n- Emphasize her preferences and comfort\n\nPERSONAL TASK LIST (Separate Project):\n- Update home office conversion plans\n- Sullivan's 9-month pediatrician checkup\n- Review Q1 consulting pipeline\n- Health tracking recalibration\n- Oura Ring data analysis\n- Sunroom office space planning\n- Schedule dentist appointment\n- Update financial tracking spreadsheet\n\nRecommendation: Approach Ashley with research, not conclusions. Present options, listen more than prescribe.\n\nWant me to start drilling into the nanny research first?",
