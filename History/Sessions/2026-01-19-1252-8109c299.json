Orlando Security Meeting: \n   - Determine key contacts\n   - Draft meeting invite\n   - Send scheduling request\n3. Orlando Specs Email:\n   - Locate most recent spec draft\n   - Review and finalize\n   - Prepare email to send specs\n\nWould you like me to help you draft the meeting invite or email, given the task creation tools are currently unavailable?",
