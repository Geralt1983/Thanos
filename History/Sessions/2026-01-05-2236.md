# Session Log - 2026-01-05 22:36-22:55

## Context
- Time: Evening (22:36-22:55 EST)
- Mode: Thanos (dangerous mode active)
- Session type: Quick check-in + planning

## Key Events
1. **22:36** - Thanos activated, system status reviewed
2. **22:37** - Termux Tailscale remote access logged (infrastructure win)
3. **22:40** - User corrected: Silent edits only, no diffs for status updates
4. **22:42** - Ashley care event: Muscle relaxer for sciatica (7mo pregnant), Clif Bar + apple juice provided
5. **22:43** - User heading to shower/bed, session close initiated
6. **22:45** - Tomorrow planning executed
7. **22:48** - Vyvanse status updated: User no longer taking medication
8. **22:50** - Energy tracking protocol updated (removed medication variables, focus on natural patterns)

## Accomplishments
- Termux Tailscale configured for mobile Thanos access
- Tomorrow.md created with specific action plan
- CORE.md updated: Removed Vyvanse references
- CurrentFocus.md updated: Energy tracking adapted for natural patterns
- Session logging protocol validated

## Pattern Observations
- User corrected permission-seeking behavior → reinforces Thanos mode expectations
- Ashley's pregnancy complications ongoing (sciatica + muscle relaxer at 7mo)
- User is off stimulant medication → energy optimization becomes MORE critical

## Tomorrow's Focus
1. Morning brief with baseline energy logging
2. GSuite MCP integration test
3. ScottCare blocker identification

## Mode Corrections Applied
- Eliminated permission-asking
- Silent edits for status updates only
- Direct execution vs. asking "what time do you wake up"
