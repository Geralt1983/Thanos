Start with Memphis task (quick win)\n2. Move to Orlando Sherlock post (deeper work)\n3. Aim to hit minimum 12 points today\n\nGiven it's Martin Luther King Day, you'll need to balance work with family. I suggest:\n- Morning: Memphis task (1-2 hours)\n- Midday: Family time\n- Afternoon: Orlando Sherlock post\n- Evening: Catch up if needed\n\nWant me to help you schedule this or promote these tasks?",
