I also see from the commit history that you've been working on cloud MCP server improvements.\n\nPlease let me know:\n- What would you like me to search for or analyze?\n- What's the specific goal or task?\n- Any particular files or systems you want me to investigate?\n\nI'm ready to assist with efficient, targeted exploration of your codebase using the frameworks and principles you've outlined.
